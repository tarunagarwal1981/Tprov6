# 🔄 **Loading Spinner Issue Fix**

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

From your logs, I can see:
- ✅ Authentication is working correctly
- ✅ User profile loads with correct role `TOUR_OPERATOR`
- ✅ ProtectedRoute allows access
- ✅ Dashboard component loads
- ❌ **But loading spinner shows and page needs refresh**

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The issue is likely a **race condition** between:
1. **Login redirect** happening from login page
2. **ProtectedRoute** still showing loading state
3. **Page not updating** after redirect

## 🛠️ **Fixes Applied**

### **Fix 1: Simplified Redirect**
- Removed complex router logic
- Using `window.location.replace()` for immediate redirect
- This should eliminate the race condition

### **Fix 2: Added Debugging**
- Added console logs to track loading state
- This will help identify when/why loading spinner shows

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After the fix, you should see:
1. **Login succeeds** ✅
2. **Immediate redirect** to `/operator/dashboard` ✅
3. **No loading spinner** ✅
4. **Dashboard loads directly** ✅

## 🚀 **Test Steps**

1. **Clear browser cache/cookies**
2. **Try logging in again**
3. **Check console logs** for:
   ```
   🚀 Redirecting to dashboard: /operator/dashboard
   🔄 Using window.location.replace for immediate redirect
   ```

## 🔍 **If Issue Persists**

If you still see the loading spinner, check console for:
- `🔄 Showing loading spinner - isLoading: true`
- This will tell us if ProtectedRoute is still loading

## 📋 **Alternative Fix**

If the issue persists, we can try:
1. **Disable loading state** temporarily
2. **Use different redirect method**
3. **Add loading state management**

The simplified redirect should fix the issue!
