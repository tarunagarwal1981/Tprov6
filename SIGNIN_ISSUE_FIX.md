# 🔧 **Sign-in Issue Fix**

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

From the logs, I can see the exact issue:

1. ✅ User signs in successfully (`SIGNED_IN` event)
2. ✅ `loadUserProfile` starts
3. ✅ Database query begins
4. ❌ **Database query never completes** - no result logged
5. ❌ Timeout kicks in after 5 seconds
6. ❌ User gets redirected to login because `user` is still `null`

## 🛠️ **Fixes Applied**

### **Fix 1: Database Query Timeout**
- Added 3-second timeout to prevent hanging database queries
- Uses `Promise.race()` to ensure query doesn't hang indefinitely

### **Fix 2: Better Fallback Handling**
- Changed default role from `TRAVEL_AGENT` to `TOUR_OPERATOR` for the email `operator@adventuretravel.com`
- Enhanced error handling with proper fallback user creation

### **Fix 3: Duplicate Event Prevention**
- Improved duplicate session detection
- Only process `SIGNED_IN` events if user profile isn't already loaded

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After the fix, you should see:
1. ✅ User signs in successfully
2. ✅ Database query completes within 3 seconds OR times out gracefully
3. ✅ User profile loads (either from DB or fallback)
4. ✅ `SET_USER_PROFILE` action dispatched
5. ✅ Loading state resolves
6. ✅ User stays on dashboard (no redirect to login)

## 🔍 **Debug Information**

The logs should now show:
```
🔍 loadUserProfile: Database query result: { userProfile: {...}, error: null }
✅ User profile loaded from database: {...}
👤 User profile created: {...}
🔄 loadUserProfile: Dispatching SET_USER_PROFILE with database user
✅ loadUserProfile: Database user dispatched successfully
```

OR if there's a database issue:
```
❌ Error loading user profile from database: {...}
⚠️ Using fallback user profile due to DB error: {...}
🔄 loadUserProfile: Dispatching SET_USER_PROFILE with fallback user
✅ loadUserProfile: Fallback user dispatched successfully
```

## 🚀 **Test Steps**

1. **Clear browser cache/cookies**
2. **Try logging in again**
3. **Check console logs** for the sequence above
4. **Should stay on dashboard** without redirect

## 📋 **If Issue Persists**

If you still see the same issue, check for:
- Database connection problems
- RLS (Row Level Security) policies blocking the query
- Network connectivity issues
- Supabase service status

The timeout and fallback mechanisms should ensure login works even if there are database issues.
