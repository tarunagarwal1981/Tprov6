# Netlify Debug Test

## What This Does

This is a simple test to isolate the Netlify deployment issue. Instead of building the complex Next.js app, we're testing with simple HTML files.

## Files Created

1. **`index.html`** - Main test page with debug information
2. **`test.html`** - Simple test page
3. **`_redirects`** - Basic redirect file for SPA routing
4. **`netlify.toml`** - Updated to serve from root directory

## How to Test

1. **Commit and push these changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add simple HTML test pages for Netlify debugging"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Netlify:**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Trigger a new deployment
   - Check if `index.html` loads

3. **Debug Information:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for console logs with 🚀, 🔍, ✅, ❌ emojis
   - Check if routes are accessible
   - Verify redirects are working

## Expected Results

- ✅ If `index.html` loads → Basic deployment works
- ✅ If console shows route tests → Static files are accessible
- ✅ If navigation works → Redirects are working
- ❌ If still 404 → There's a deeper Netlify configuration issue

## Next Steps

Once we confirm basic HTML deployment works, we can:
1. Revert to Next.js build configuration
2. Debug the specific Next.js build issues
3. Fix the routing problems step by step

## Reverting Back

To go back to Next.js build:
1. Delete `index.html`, `test.html`, `_redirects` from root
2. Update `netlify.toml` to use `npm run build` and `publish = "out"`
3. Commit and redeploy
